# openEHR - FHIR Demo app


This is a minimal browser-based client-side HTML/CSS/Javascript app, which simply displays the output of several HL7 FHIR calls (Care-connect Profiles), pulling data from two different openEHR Clinical Data Repositories (CDR) via identical Archetype Query Language (AQL) statements retrieving data from standard UK openEHR templates.
